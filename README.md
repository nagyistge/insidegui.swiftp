# SwiFTP
### A (very) simple FTP client written in Swift

I had a project where I had to be able to list directories from a remote FTP server, all I needed was dir listing, so I decided to use this as an opportunity to learn some Swift. Since all I needed was directory listing, It's all this app does. The FTP protocol stuff was derived from an Apple example.

**Note: this is the very first thing I've ever written using Swift, so don't use It as a guide of best practices, I'm probably doing everything the wrong way.**
